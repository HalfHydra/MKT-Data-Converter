# MKT-Data-Converter

Update: These scripts and formatting have made it into MKT Toolbox, you can check it out at https://www.mkttoolbox.com/

A tool used to convert a json dumped from the game into many different spreadsheet formats!

This isn't the most pretty since this was originally just used for me to convert a few source jsons into a bunch of usable CSVs to distribute.

Some Sample JSONs have been included in the folder of the same name.
